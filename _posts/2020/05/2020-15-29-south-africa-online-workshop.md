The global COVID-19 pandemic did not leave South African Carpentry workshops unscathed. Under an ongoing national lockdown, tertiary institutions have are closed which leaves students without internet and access to computer laboratories. Past studies have indicated that only 10% of South African households have access to internet at home. Mobile internet prices in South Africa has been quoted as one of the most expensive globally.

 There is a silverlining, various universities have stepped up to bridge the digital divide and are offering access to laptops and mobile data for students to continue the academic year online (on loadn or reduced prices). SADiLaR used this 'chopportunity' to host itsâ€™ first three day [Online Data Carpentry Workshop](https://sadilar.github.io/2020-05-05-SA-ONLINE/) from May 5-7. Six learners from South Africa and the United Kingdom attended the online workshop. The workshop covered the [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) curriculum.

The workshop was run by three experienced instructors who taught the lesson content (Spreadsheets, OpenRefine and R) and one instructor as technical coordinator (in charge of the Zoom room, keeping an eye on questions and sticky feedback after each session).
In total seven supporting instructors assisted during breakout sessions and tasks/challenges over the three days. Instructors consulted the [online workshop recommendations](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/),
and the [guideline for cloud instances](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/) of RStudio and OpenRefine in preparation of the workshop.

**What did we do**:

- kept video off to save bandwith (resulted in 100-200mb data usage per hour)
- [Online stickies](https://pinup.com/) for feedback after each session
- 10 minute break for every 50 minutes taught
- used [Zooms' non-verbal feedback functions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-Feedback-During-Meetings) for red and green stickies
- Zoom chat and a collaborative document (Google Documents since the Etherpads were down) to ask questions and communicate with
- Small number of learners
- Breakout rooms for support
- Screen setup: if the learner did not have access to a second screen, to arrange your screen to see Zoom and application together
- A lot of interrupting - Since the instructor was not able to see the chat, hands raised or red/green stickies most of the time.


## Sticky feedback

In what follows we summarise the learners' experiences from the [Data Carpentry Online Workshop](https://sadilar.github.io/2020-05-05-SA-ONLINE/)

#### What worked

- **Technical instructor/coordinator**<br>
  <p><i>  "Intructor and coordinator ensure that we were all in the same page and before moving on to the next step or concept"</i></p>
- **Having patience** - We need to remember that online teaching is new to both the instructor and the learners <br>
<p><i>"Thank you for your patience"</i></p>
- **Online format can work**<br>
<p><i>"I was worried about about how a online workshop will work but with the syllabus and google doc it works so well!!" <br> "The digital format is working much better that I had thougt it would"</i></p>
- **Make time to excerise newly learned skills**<br>
<p><i>"The exercise on data validation gave me lots of ideas about how to get better data input that will require less tidying up."</i></p>
- **Live coding online**<br>
<p><i>"Watching her live coding gave me ideas for how I should be using RStudio*"<br> "It is easy to see the code on the screen, much better than Skype" </i></p>
- **Copying code in chat *AFTER* live coding**<br>
<p><i>"Thanks for all the code in the chat. It was so helpful."</i></p>
- **Green sticky check-in/questions** continuous check-ins with learners after new skills were taught<br>
<p><i>"Thanks for stopping to take questions, it really helped with my understanding*"<br> "One on one focus when the particpant is having problems" <br> "And I liked the one on one sessions when someone is having problems"</i></p>
- **Learners sharing their screens in main room in stead of breakout room** since breakout rooms resulted in many dropped calls<br>
 <p><i>"....where i was struggling, I shared my screen so that everyone can see what I was experience and because they are so experienced they could easily pick up mistake"</i></p>
- **Teaching moments when making mistakes**<br>
<p><i>"The way you help each other as well, it shows that instructors are people and they can mistakes as well."</i></p>
- **Zoom chat as mode of communication**<br>
<p><i>"Wow, so helpful and efficient!"</i></p>



#### What did not work

- **Technical difficulties** - installation issues still present<br>
<p><i>"Some minor technical hassles, but I think that's more a case of teething pains with the new format, rather than any inherent faults"<br>
 "There was a bit of fumbling getting screens to share right, getting the right stuff installed at the right time" <br>
 "It was slow to get started because of problems getting tidyverse installed"</i></p>
- **Long days online** - 6 hour Zoom days<br>
<p><i>"It was a bit of cognitive overload toward the end of the day. Not so much because it was too much info, but because fatigue had been setting in after a long day"<br>
"Lots of information to absorb, but i also think it is up to the individual to practice this""<br> "Lots of information to take in very quickly"
 <br> "this is really a lot of work and new knowledge to fit into a very short amount of time..."</i></p>

 <u>  However, some felt differently</u>:

  <p><i>"I'm enjoying doing the intensive three days" <br> "Learned a lot , and looking forward to using the new skills in my next projects"</i></p>

- **Speed at what the lessons took place**<br>
 <p><i>"We did go through everything very fast" & "Super fast tour of loads of different features"</i></p>



#### The way forward

- **Shorter days** host the workshop over more days but shorter sessions to avoid fatigue<br>
  <p><i>"When it's a traditional/physical workshop, it makes sense for logistical and practical reasons to have everything over three (or however many) days on end.
In this digital/remote format, it might make sense to lay some groundwork in the first day or two, let that sink in a little bit, and then continue with the final sessions
a few days or even a week later. Overall, I think it would be good to look at ways of mitigating learner fatigue"</i></p>
- Encourage the use of **mobile devices**  (i.e tablets or mobile phones) if second screen is not available <br><br>
-Make **more time** to practice newly gained skills<br>
  <p><i>"It would be great to have time to try some of the techniques in exercises as we went along" <br> "I would have liked a few 1 minute pauses to try and test out ideas"</i></p>
-**Make use of [cloud instances](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/scaffolds/) for installation issues**<br><br>
-Always have a **"back-up" instructor** just incase something goes wrong (Murphy!)<br><br>
- SADiLaR are looking into ways how we can **support learners within South Africa with limited access** to internet attend online Carpentry workshops!<br><br>

> *"Really like the digital format and hope it can be expanded on in future!"*

>"*Overall this is the best workshop I have been to in a long time and 100% the best online workshop ever*."


Overall the feedback was generally really positive and we are looking forward to implementing our findings in the next online workshop! Do you want to host a workshop or learn more about teaching Carpentries workshops online? Contact [Angelique van Rensburg](mailto:admin-afr@carpentries.org).
